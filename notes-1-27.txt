Paper
- have on github for now 
- will be uploading to overleaf 
- right now its state is super raw/rough

today/this weekend
- upload sources to zotero so that bibtex file can be generated //jeannette
- inventory/checklist of exactly what silicone castings needed  //owner
- assign ownership for figures

have 4 weeks, can we have draft in 2?

week 1 (by 2/3)   
        - pressure values/bit commands set in yaml file for each material  //Isaiah
        - load cell calibrated, integrated into test script with hysteresis //Jeannette
        - test.py scripts finalized for each test //Jeannette
        - all silicone tubes capped (based on checklist) //owner?
        - line detection script exports file of coordinates of inner and outer line done //Joya
        - code to take in folder of photos and export coords all at once done //Joya 
        - calculations matlab outlined //Jeannette
        - modelling matlab (neo-hookean bending moments) matlab done //Jeannette
        - FEA simulation for one silicone (dragon 20?) 

week 2 (by 2/10) 
        - data taken for each silicone //owner?
        - calculations matlab done //Jeannette

        - VERSION 1 FIGURES
            success:
                - sample photos decided on for photo figures
                - matlab graphs exported as **file type** 

            - bio inspiration compared to our actuator (for first page?) [photos] //owner?
            - fabrication [diagram] //Ruslana
            - fabrication [photos] //Ruslana
            - testing setup for curvature [photos] //owner?
            - testing setup for blocking force [photos] //owner?
            - pressure rig setup [diagram] //mike 
            - cv process //joya
            - model neo-hookean const curvature v pressure (for each silicone) //jeannette
            - model blocking force v pressure (for each silicone) //jeannette
            - FEA simulation  

            (results figs subject to change)
            - non constant curvature over pressure [photos] //owner?
            - non constant curvature over pressure [data] //jeannette
            - blocking force over pressure [photos] //owner?
            - blocking force over pressure [data] //jeannette
            - non-axial or hoop strain over length over pressure [photos] //owner?
            - non-axial or hoop strain over length over pressure [data] //jeannette

        - COMPLETE PAPER DRAFT done
            - success: 
                - all sources attached to a sentence
                - each section has something in it 
                - conclusions/abstract drafted 
                - all figures have at least version 1
                - under 8 pages (with bibliography)

week 3 (by 2/17)
     - send paper to various advisors, asking questions reviewers will ask 
        - all figures get updated 
            - success: 
                - looks clear when printed in black and white
                - more data added to data figures 
        - photos finalized (my dad is in town presidents day weekend and can help photoshop)
        - get writing to 7 pages? 


week 4 (by 2/24) 
        - writing down to 6 pages? 
        - send final drafts to advisors

Monday 2/27 submit?
